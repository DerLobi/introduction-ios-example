This is an example of a simple iOS app without dependencies, that can be created in an hour. It is based on a presentation I did.

The app performs a network request to the trakt.tv API, parses JSON and displays the results in a tableView.

## Installation
Get your own API key from http://trakt.tv and enter it in `APIKey.swift`
